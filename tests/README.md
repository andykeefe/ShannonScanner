**SCAN AND COMPLIANCE OUTPUT DIRECTORY**

The purpose of this directory is to store the tests that result from the scanning and compliance checking operations. 

I'm looking into ways to redirect the output depending on the user's preference, but since this is a command line tool, I want to cut down as much as possible on the length of each command input.
